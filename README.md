Project 0  for CS50W

For this project I decided to create an online portfolio that consists of four pages:
- index.html which is an introduction to the site and includes an image
- education.html which includes unordered lists
- skills.html which includes an html table with fontawesome icons
- interests.html which includes dummy texts and a "table" made from bootstrap grid

Each page has a bootstrap navbar which allows you to move to any page in the website.

The stylesheet 'styles.css' results from the SASS sheet 'styles.sass'.  The stylesheet includes the following selectors
    #id
    .class
    @media
    h1
    a:hover
and properties
    color
    background-image
    background-size
    background-color
    margin

Bootstrap 4 was used for this website. The 'styles.sass' demonstrates both nesting and inheritance.
